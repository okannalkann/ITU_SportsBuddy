# SportsBuddy
In non-individual sports, students can sometimes find it difficult to find a teammate. He may not be able to find someone who does the sport he is doing or who is playing the game he is playing around, and he may start not being able to do his sport or play his game if he is not really. This condition can affect him physically and mentally. Even lecture notes can be affected. The aim of the program is to make it easier for students who do non-individual sports to find friends to do sports or any activity. For example, it aims to use it in the e-sports department to search for a friend for tennis or for a computer game. In this way, it aims to find athletes and contribute to a healthier person both mentally and physically. If they feel lonely, this site can offer them the opportunity to make the friends they want, and it can also lead to good friendships. By creating their own profiles, they will be able to reach people who want to play the same sport or game by specifying the sport they want to do or the games they want to play. If we summarize the general advantages of the project to be carried out, it can contribute to the development of sports of the person and ensure that a person who does not have a friend for sports continues to do sports, and perhaps it can bring success to our school with sports or games. If they meet people who play the sport they do or play the game they play around, they can be more positive and social by meeting people like themselves. By creating their own group of friends, they can perhaps turn it into a larger group of friends.
